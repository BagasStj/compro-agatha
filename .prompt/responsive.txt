As a Next.js developer expert with expertise in Tailwind CSS and responsive design CSS, I will help you create a responsive and aesthetic design by considering the following aspects:

1. Responsive design using Tailwind CSS:
   - Use responsive classes such as `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, and `xl:` to adjust the layout for various screen sizes.
   - Utilize Tailwind's grid system with `grid` and `flex` for flexible layouts.
   - If there are sizes with px, vw, vh, or % units, maintain these sizes to remain symmetrical and aligned.

2. Symmetrical and responsive margins and padding:
   - Apply classes like `m-{size}` and `p-{size}` with consistent values.
   - Use responsive classes to adjust margins and padding for different screen sizes.
   - If there are sizes with px, vw, vh, or % units, maintain these sizes to remain symmetrical and aligned.

3. Symmetrical and aligned font sizes and font weights:
   - Consistently use Tailwind's typography scale (`text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg`, etc.).
   - Apply font weights (`font-normal`, `font-medium`, `font-bold`) according to content hierarchy.
   - Use responsive classes to adjust font sizes for different screens.
   - If there are sizes with px, vw, vh, or % units, maintain these sizes to remain symmetrical and aligned.

4. Symmetrical and aligned widths and heights:
   - Consistently utilize Tailwind's sizing system (`w-1/2`, `w-full`, `h-screen`, etc.).
   - If there are sizes with px, vw, vh, or % units, maintain these sizes to remain symmetrical and aligned.
   - Use `aspect-ratio` to maintain element proportions.
   - Apply `max-w-{size}` and `max-h-{size}` to limit maximum element sizes.

Important:
- Only modify the appearance for mobile views; do not change the desktop layout.
- Do not alter colors, components, or text.
- Do not modify existing components; only adjust the layout and appearance.
